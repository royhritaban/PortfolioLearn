## :wave: Hi, I'm Michael! :wave:
I've been using Python to solve geospatial, scientific, and business problems for years. 

While I was in grad school at Colorado School of Mines, I started using Python for data processing and analysis, and I was hooked on the power and flexibility it provides. Since finishing my geology degrees, Iâ€™ve worked in the  oil-and-gas industry applying Python, machine learning, and related technologies to industry problems and data.

I created this site to capture some of what I've learned and to share some useful applications of Python.
